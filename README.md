## 1. Project Title / Headline  

**🌦️ Weather_Forecast: Live Weather Intelligence Dashboard**  

An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes real-time and forecast weather data to support climate monitoring, daily planning, and data-driven decision-making.

---

## 2. Short Description / Purpose  

The **Weather_Forecast Dashboard** is a live Power BI report that consumes data from a weather API to present real-time weather conditions and short-term forecasts.  
It enables users to monitor temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and weather conditions in a clear, interactive, and visually intuitive format.

---

## 3. Tech Stack  

The dashboard was developed using the following technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** – Core platform for building interactive reports and visuals  
- **Power Query** – API connection, JSON parsing, data cleansing, and transformation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Measures for KPIs, trends, averages, and conditional logic  
- **Weather API Integration** – Live REST API for real-time and forecast weather data  
- **Data Modeling** – Structured tables for current weather, forecast data, and location metadata  
- **File Format** – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for previews

## 5. Features / Highlights  

### Business Problem  

Access to accurate and real-time weather information is critical for individuals, businesses, and operational planning.  
However, raw API responses are technical and difficult to interpret without visualization.

Challenges include:
- Lack of real-time analytical dashboards  
- Difficulty extracting insights from JSON-based API data  
- No centralized platform for weather trend analysis  

---

### Goal of the Dashboard  

The **Weather_Forecast Dashboard** aims to:

- Provide real-time weather visibility in a single interface  
- Convert raw API data into meaningful insights  
- Support travel planning, operational decisions, and monitoring  
- Demonstrate real-time analytics capabilities using Power BI
